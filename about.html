            <p style="text-indent: 45px;">
                I attended Kennesaw State University from August 2018 to May 2023. I graduated with a major in Computer Science. 
                In the computer science program I took courses on many different computer science concepts 
                such as programming and problem solving, database design, computer organization and architecture, 
                data structures, algorithm analysis, concepts of programming languages, parallel and distributed programming, 
                operating systems, UI/UX design, artificial intelligence, technical writing, software architecture design, 
                and computer graphics and multimedia.

            <h1>Work Experience</h1>

            <p style="text-indent: 45px;">
                I worked for Chick-Fil-A at Arbor Place Mall for 4 years. This was from May of 2019 to June of 2023. 
                At Chick-Fil-A I worked as a Senior Team Member and gained valuable leadership experience, and team work.
                As a Senior Team member I led many shifts where I was entrusted with leading others in keeping the safety and 
                food quality standards of Chick-Fil-A met. Working at Chick-Fil-A is like working as a machine where each person 
                has a vital role and must work together with other team members. This ensured that the team members must have 
                good and clear communication with eachother.
