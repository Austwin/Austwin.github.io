        <h2>Senior Project: Dynamic Grocery List</h2>
        <p>
            This project was done during my last semester of college. I worked in a group with 3 other individuals. I 
            was in charge of all the documentation for the project and I did not do any programming but I did 
            heavily plan out the structure of the application and write the documentation. This project taught me a lot 
            about the software development lifecycle and how to plan out and execute a project. 
            We created an Android app that listed out different items that needed to be bought as the user added them to 
            their grocery list. The project was incomplete but we were able to create the pages and some of the functionality.
            Some of the unfinished features include a group feature and a chat feature. The project was written in Kotlin 
            using Android Studio. We used FireBase for our database and the authentication service. You can view the SRS, other
            project documents, and learn more detail about the project by viewing our project website below.
