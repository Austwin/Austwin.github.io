        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>I went to Chapel Hill High School in Douglasville GA. At Chapel Hill High I made a 4.0 GPA and took several AP courses and was part of the National Honor Society. I was involved in the NJROTC program at the school. In the NJROTC program I was involved in multiple teams such as Color Guard, Drill Team, and Academic Team. I also was put in serveral leadership positions such as Color Guard commander, Drill Team commander, Company officer, Executive officer, and Battalion Commander. In each of these positions I actively led cadets and managed them.</p>
        <h2>Eagle Scout</h2>
        <p>I was in the Boy Scouts of America and became an Eagle Scout. Becoming an Eagle Scout involves managing and leading a project that you come up with that supports the community in some way. I built benches for the church that hosted my troop. Only about 4 percent of all Boy Scouts become Eagle Scouts.</p>
        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>At KSU I studied computer science. The different topics that I learned include, Java and C# programming, database design, computer organization and architecture, data structures, algorithm analysis, data communications, concepts of programming languages, artificial intelligence, UI/UX design, parallel and distributed programming, and I completed a senior project that is listed in the project section.</p>
