        <h3>Dynamic Grocery List</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 45px;">
            This project was done during my last semester of college. I worked in a group with 3 other individuals. I 
            was in charge of all the documentation for the project and I didn't actually do any programming but I did 
            heavily plan out the application and write the documentation. This project taught me a lot about the software
            development lifecycle and how to plan out and execute a project. 
            We created an Android app that listed out different items that needed to be bought as the user added them to 
            their list. The project was incomplete but we were able to create the pages and some of the functionality.
            Some of the unfinished features include a group feature and a chat feature. The project was written in Kotlin 
            using Android Studio. We used FireBase for our database and autentication service. You can view the SRS, other
            project documents, and learn more detail about the project by viewing our project website below.

        <h3>CRM Python App</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 45px;">
            In this project I followed along a tutorial to build a Customer Relatations Management site using HTML, Python, and Django. 
            I used a virtual environment to build this project and install the packages needed for the project. I used MySQL as the database
            for this project. View the project code by clicking the link below. To run the server for the app change your directory to the first
            'manage.py' folder and type the command 'python manage.py runserver'. This will allow you to view the site and interact with it.

        <h3>Social Media Dashboard</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 45px;">
            In this project I followed along a tutorial to build a social media dashboard that can toggle between light and dark mode.
            The numbers in the dashboard are hardcoded and isn't actually conntected to any profiles. The purpose of this project was to learn 
            SCSS and not to build a functioning dashboard. The project is built with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and uses a Gulp workflow to automatically
            update the website once changes are made. This happens because the Gulp file runs JavaScript scripts to update the page each time the 
            project files are saved. To view this project see the GitHub by clicking the link below. To view the website, open the project in a 
            code editor and go to the terminal and type 'gulp'. This should start the server and open the website.
